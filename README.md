ABSTRACT
------------
Dam failures are a large scale, low probability but high-risk events. Currently the only information available to the general population are Reservoir Flood Maps (RFM's). Which fail to accurately inform the general public on the risks involved, as well as any valuable information - for people who live near them. This GUI is used to communicate across the risk of Dam Failures in a more simple, easier-to-understand manner. It presents the user with ifformation on dams in a way that allows them to construct their own, informed opninon. 


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Pull/download ALL files 

2. Open the script in an IDE of your choice - ensuring the correct version of PyQt is installed (see REQUIREMENTS)

3. Run script


REQUIREMENTS
-------------

This GUI was developed using Python 3.7, with the main module being PyQt5 - please ensure PyQt5 is correctly installed 
on your machine. 

* Python 3.7 can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

* PyQt5 can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ or by command 'pip install PyQt5'


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The app was developed on a Windows 10 system in Spyder 4.0.1.
